# 🅿️ IntelliPark – Multilevel Parking Kiosk System

> A Java-based intelligent kiosk interface for managing a multilevel vehicle parking facility using a graphical Swing UI, 3D array logic, MySQL for persistence, and Dijkstra’s algorithm for optimal space allocation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**IntelliPark** is a smart kiosk application that allows users and attendants to:
- **Add** vehicles to the parking system
- **Locate** parked vehicles
- **Remove** vehicles from any slot
- **Relocate** vehicles optimally using real-time availability
- **Persist** vehicle data using a MySQL database
- **Visually interact** using an intuitive Java Swing-based GUI

The system is tailored for real-world multilevel parking lots, with support for floors, rows, and columns, simulating constrained vehicle flow using ramp directions and accessibility logic.

## 🛠 Features

- 🔢 3D Matrix Representation of Parking stored in a file system: `[floor][row][column]`
- 📊 Persistent Storage with MySQL
- 🧠 Dijkstra’s Algorithm for optimal relocation & space allocation
- 👤 Swing-based GUI for intuitive operation
- 🔐 Input validation and duplicate checks
- 🛣️ Simulates up/down ramp constraints
